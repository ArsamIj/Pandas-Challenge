Pandas-Challenge

This challenge requires us to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Using the provided dataset, we used multiple pandas methods to clean, sort, and analyze the data, which allows us to make informed decisions about the future of the distric schools.

  2. Lowest-Performing Schools
  3. Math Scores by Grade
  4. Reading Scores by Grade
  5. Scores by School Spending
  6. Scores by School Size
  7. Scores by School Type

With our analysis complete we concluded the following as example of our assessment:
